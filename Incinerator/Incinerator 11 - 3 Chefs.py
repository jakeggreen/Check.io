"""You are the owner of a cafe where 3 chefs work: a JapaneseCook, RussianCook and ItalianCook. Each of them can prepare the national food and beverage:
- JapaneseCook: Sushi and Tea;
- RussianCook: Dumplings and Compote;
- ItalianCook: Pizza and Juice.
Your task is to create 3 different subclasses (one for each chef) which are the children of an AbstractCook and have these methods:
- add_food(food_amount, food_price), which add to the client's order the value of the food which he had chosen;
- add_drink(drink_amount, drink_price), which add to the client's order the value of the drink which he had chosen;
- total(), which returns a string like: 'Foods: 150, Drinks: 50, Total: 200', and for the each chef instead of the Foods and Drinks will be the national food and drink that heâ€™s used.
Every client can choose only one chef."""
